    //       around, and become negative. We therefore use Math.floorMod()

    //       expect with negative inputs. (In some languages, e.g. Python, it
    //       does, in others, e.g. Java, it doesn't. There are two valid ways
    //       to implement it, and each language chooses one or the other.)
    //       floorMod() will always give a non-negative result (< LARGE_PRIME)
    //       even if initialHash * a + b is negative.)
    // NOTE: We then mod by size to bring the hash into the right range.
    // NOTE: (redistributed won't be negative, so we needn't use floorMod()
    //       here. Also, once we've modded by size - which is an int - the
    //       result will necessarily be in the range of an int, so we can safely
    //       cast the result to int without worrying about overflow. Note that
    //       if we had written (int) redistributed % size, that would have
    //       casted redistributed to an int (which may result in overflow), and
    //       _then_ modded, whereas we want to cast _after_ modding by size,
    //       hence the parentheses around redistributed % size.)
